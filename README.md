### THE CHALLENGE THE HOSPITAL MANAGEMENT SYSTEM IS ADDRESSING 
Hospitals are an important part of our life, giving the greatest medical care to patients suffering from a variety of ailments caused by climate changes, increased work-load, emotional trauma, stress, and other
factors. Hospitals must keep track of their day-to-day activities, patient data, doctors, nurses, and other workers in order to keep the hospital functioning efficiently and successfully. 
Keeping paper records and maintaining all of these documents is highly unreliable, time-consuming, inefficient, and error-prone, as evidenced by the ongoing increase in population and the number of
individuals visiting the hospital. It is getting increasingly uneconomical or technically infeasible.
As a result, we'll use the manual system as the foundation for our project. We intend to create a computerised version of the manual system called "Hospital Managements System(HMS)".
Our project's major goal is to shift the manual recording system (through paper) to a database as a more effective approach to maintain medical records up to date. It also tries to automate existing systems at a low cost and with high reliability. At every level of user-system interaction, the system provides high data security, as well as robust and reliable storage and backup features. The further adoption of blockchain is to make patients' information decentralised, so it may be used in any hospital that uses our blockchain network.
### PROGRAMMING LANGUAGE TO BE USED:
HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Python(Django Framework), SQL, and Solidity.
